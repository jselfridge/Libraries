LinAlg_Sandbox
=============

This set of code serves as a snadbox for implementing linear
algebra functionality within the C programming language.  The
code relies on the CLAPACK library which is built upon a Basic
Linear Algebra Subroutine (BLAS) foundation.  This capability 
will be incorporated into "SampleSim" which is the sandbox 
program for developing Matlab-like capabilities within a 
C language.
