Libraries
=========

This repository contains various libraries that are useful
for a wide variety of coding projects.  Some are for general 
purpose programs, and others are specific to the BBB platform.


MatLib
------
The <code>MatLib</code> library implements a variety of linear 
algebra functions in the C language so it is particularly 
applicable to embedded system architecture.


RotLib
------
The <code>RotLib</code> library contains functions that are 
needed to perform various types of roational transformations.  
It is built upon the <code>MatLib</code> library, and is useful
for both simulations and hardware applications.


OptLib
------
The <code>OptLib</code> library performs optimization 
routines.  Currently, it only supports a gradient method 
type of optimization, but others may be added in the 
future.


CtrlLib
-------
The <code>CtrlLib</code> library is an extrension of the 
<code>MatLib</code> library, and performs functions that are 
focused on controls analysis, design, and simulation.
