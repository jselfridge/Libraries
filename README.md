=========

This repository contains various libraries that are useful
for a wide variety of coding projects.  

The 'MatLib' Library implements a variety of linear algebra 
functions in the C language so it is particularly applicable to
embedded systems architecture.

The 'RotLib' Library contains functions that are needed to 
perform various types of roational transformations.  Useful
for both simulations and hardware applications.

The 'Debug' directory contains code to test the various libraries
